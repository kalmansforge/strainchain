# StrainChain

## Introduction

StrainChain is a unique blockchain-based platform that links cannabis growers, users, and researchers through an ecosystem of strain-specific blockchains. Our system gathers data from IoT devices, users' feedback, and interaction with cannabis strains, fostering a transparent supply chain.

Explore our network of interconnected strain-specific blockchains, offering detailed information about each strain, from supply chain data to user experiences. We believe in creating a holistic and informed cannabis community where every participant's voice matters.
